UHome -- Unix Home

There is *so much* you can do to tidy up your $HOME.

But who can remember all that... or be bothered to set
it up on a new installation?

If only someone had written a script that would do it
for you...

The setup has a number of goals:

- Minimizing the number of files residing in your $HOME
  by using subdirectories.

- Making these subdirectories relocatable if you set the
  XDG_*_HOME environment variables.

The setup has the form of a script for several reasons:

- Some steps require reacting to what is already set up.

- Teching about these settings is part of the purpose.

- It enables you to customize things to your preference.
